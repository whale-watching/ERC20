# ERC20

This is my ERC20 implementation. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This ERC20 implementation aims to exactly follow the [ERC20 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), with no added features beyond the most basic ones. Its goals are to be correct, clear, and cost effective in terms of gas.

This ERC20 implementation borrows heavily from dapphub's [DSToken](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-token). Mostly I've simplified and clarified it.
